# Sensor calibration status.
#
# Status values:
#   calibrated   — values are in expected engineering units
#   uncalibrated — values are raw ADC counts or have wrong scaling
#
# Calibration status is determined empirically by:
#   1. Comparing DAT values against JSON ground truth (where both exist)
#   2. Checking distributions against PHYSICAL_RANGES
#   3. Running: python scripts/diagnose_sensor_distributions.py
#
# After applying dat_corrections.yaml, most DAT sensors produce
# physically plausible values. Remaining outliers are flagged by the
# diagnostics script rather than hardcoded here.

# ═══ Fully calibrated sensors (all machines, both formats) ═══
# These produce plausible engineering-unit values everywhere.
